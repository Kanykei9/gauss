			<p class="title">Gauss-Jordan Method</p>
			
			<p class="description">
				Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1810 devised a notation for symmetric elimination that was adopted 
				in the 19th century by professional hand computers to solve the normal equations of 
				least-squares problems. In 1888, Wilhelm Jordan discovered a way to extend Gaussian 
				Elimination, so mathematicians have named the process Gauss-Jordan Elimination. Gauss-Jordan 
				Elimination involves using elementary row operations to write a system or equations, or 
				matrix, in reduced-row echelon form.
			</p>

			<p class="description">Gauss-Jordan Elimination is an algorithm that can be used to 
				solve systems of linear equations and to find the inverse of any 
				invertible matrix. It relies upon three elementary row operations one can use on a matrix.
			</p>

			
			

			<p class="description">The Gauss Jordan Elimination's main purpose is to use the 3 
				elementary row operations on an augmented matrix to reduce it into the reduced row 
				echelon form (RREF). A matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form, also known 
				as row canonical form.

			<p class="title">Gauss-Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel Methods</p>
			<p class="title">or Iteration Methods</p>

			<p class="description">In numerical linear algebra, the Gauss-Seidel method, also known as 
				the Liebmann method or the method of successive displacement, is an iterative method 
				used to solve a system of linear equations. It is named after the German mathematicians 
				Carl Friedrich Gauss and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel, and is similar to the Jacobi method. 
				Though it can be applied to any matrix with non-zero elements on the diagonals, 
				convergence is only guaranteed if the matrix is either strictly diagonally dominant, or 
				symmetric and positive definite.
			</p>

			<p class="description">The Gauss-Seidel method is the modification of the gauss-iteration 
				method.This modification reduces the number of iteration. In this methods the value of 
				unknown immediately reduces the number of iterations, the calculated value replace the 
				earlier value only at the end of the iteration. .Because of it, the gauss-seidel methods 
				converges much faster than the Gauss methods. In gauss seidel methods the number of 
				iteration method requires obtaining the solution is much less as compared to Gauss method.
			</p>

			<p class="description">
				The difference between the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods is that the Jacobi method uses 
				the values obtained from the previous step while the Gauss-Seidel method always applies the 
				latest updated values during the iterative procedures.
			</p>

			<p class="description">
				The reason the Gauss-Seidel method is commonly known as the successive displacement method 
				is because the second unknown is determined from the first unknown in the current iteration, 
				the third unknown is determined from the first and second unknowns, and so on.
